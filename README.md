# NPC Dialogue - AI-Powered Fantasy NPC

## Overview

**NPC Dialogue** is an interactive AI-powered chatbot that simulates a conversation with Garrick, a seasoned merchant and quest-giver in the fantasy realm of Eldoria. The project leverages the Gemini API for natural language processing and Gradio for a user-friendly web interface. Garrick responds to user queries in a light medieval style, offering information about quests, wares, and local lore.

## Features

- **Inventory System**: Garrick has a detailed inventory of items, each with descriptions and prices, which he can discuss with the user.
- **Sarcastic Responses**: If the user repeats a question, Garrick responds with a witty and sarcastic remark.
- **Follow-up Suggestions**: The system generates three follow-up questions based on the conversation to keep the dialogue flowing.
- **Customizable UI**: The Gradio interface is styled with custom CSS for an immersive experience.
